# Comp3940_Assignment02 (GROUP 4)

 This is a custom Java web server that replicates the file upload functionality of our Assignment I.When the user specifies the URL of our web server on the browser, a file upload page appears.  The user then can upload an image file from a local folder and upload it to the server along with additional form data such as the date and caption of the Image.  Then the server saves the received file in a folder on its own file system along with the form data and then server returns an alphabetically sorted listing of the images folder as a response.
